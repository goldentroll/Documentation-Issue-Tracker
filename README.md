# WordPress Documentation Issue Tracker

Welcome to the WordPress project documentation issue tracker. We're glad you are here to help make the WordPress documentation better.

The WordPress ecosystem is vast and the numerous sub-projects use a variety of tools to manage their project. This makes knowing where to report an issue complicated. That's where this repository comes in, to create **a single spot anyone can report a documentation issue**.

**How do I report an issue?**

At the top of this GitHub repository is an Issues tab, click on that tab. The next page will show a green button for "New issue" in the top right, click there to start an issue filling out the template as complete as possible. See [GitHub's official documentation for issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues).

Thank you for taking the time to report an issue.

**How can I help manage issues?**

We need help reviewing existing issues to make sure they are relevant and actionable. This practice is often referred to as "triage" and is an important contribution. The steps for triage are:

- Validate - make sure the issue is accurate and still valid
- Categorize - assign the proper lables for project or area
- Prioritize - set a priority level for the issue

**How can I contribute to documentation?**

Great, we welcome all contributors and documentation is a great way to get staretd helping build WordPress.  This repository is an issue tracker to contribute documentation you will need to go directly to one of the sub-projects.
